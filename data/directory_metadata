This directory contains analysis files and a structured dataset 
pertaining to a study that is monitored by the FDA. 
It includes a readme.md file and two folders, each with a single file. 
The directory contains a CSV file with a COVID-19 vaccine and mortality dataset, 
which offers crucial information for assessing how well the vaccine lowers 
mortality rates among those infected with the virus. A QMD file with an 
analysis of the dataset and insights into the study's conclusions is also 
available. The directory aids the FDA in evaluating how immunizations affected 
pandemic-related public health outcomes.
